# Approach
The algorithm involves moving two pointers (left and right) along the string `s` to find the longest window in which we can replace at most `k` characters with other characters to obtain a string of the same length. As the pointers move, we keep track of the frequency of characters in the window using the `chars_frequency` map. We update the maximum frequency of characters in the window and move the `left_pointer` if the difference between the window's length and the maximum frequency exceeds the value `k`. We update the maximum window length with each pointer movement.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the string `s`. The algorithm iterates through the string `s` exactly once, moving the left and right pointers a total of n times.

- **Space complexity**: is **O(26) = O(1)**, because we have a maximum of 26 different alphabet letters (both lowercase and uppercase), which is a constant number of characters to store in the `chars_frequency` map.
