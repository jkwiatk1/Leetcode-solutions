# Solution
The isMirror function checks if two trees are mirror images of each other. The isSymmetric function checks if a given binary tree is symmetric by checking if its left subtree is a mirror image of its right subtree.

In the example usage, we construct a binary tree and call the isSymmetric function to check if it's a mirror tree or not. We then free the memory allocated for the nodes of the binary tree.

# Solution2
The isSymmetric function uses a queue to perform iterative level-order traversal of the binary tree. The queue initially contains the root's left and right children. In each iteration of the while loop, it extracts two nodes from the queue and checks if they are mirror images of each other. If they are, it adds their left and right children to the queue. If they are not, it returns false. If the queue becomes empty, it means that all nodes have been processed and the binary tree is symmetric.
